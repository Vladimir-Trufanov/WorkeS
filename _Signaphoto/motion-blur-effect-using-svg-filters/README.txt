A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/damianmuti/pen/MvYPPa.

 This is an experiment that simulates a motion blur effect every time a slide is switched. It takes advantage of SVG Gaussian Blur filter and some CSS keyframes animation.
Although the effect does not require any Javascript to properly work, in this example Javascript is only used for the slider functionality.

Disclaimer:
Only works on Chrome/Firefox.
